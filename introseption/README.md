So, I'm very clear about what I'm ngoing to persue. So I can say that because of my desire you can choose me.
### What is your plan for next 6 months ?

I'm confident that I can give my best to get recruited into this club. So, my present goal is to join this club. After joining this club I'll try to improve my coding skills. So, my current plan is to get recruited into this club.
